# Code Analysis

## Lexical Analysis(词法分析)

A scanner which is to split a pile of codes to meaningful units. At the meantime, delete codes useless. Just like words.

## Grammar Analysis(语法分析)

A grammar analysis uses the result of Lexical Analysis' to analyse some of that units. Just like combining words as a sentence.

## Unit

A unit should be with Semantic Value.
For examples, 912, it should be 912|Number; "Hello", should be "Hello"|String.
But like "(); {}" are meaningless, so we ignore them.
We just need necessary information to compile, the less the better.

## Token

Unit text and semantic value are Tokens.
