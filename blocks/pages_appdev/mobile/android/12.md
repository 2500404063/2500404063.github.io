## Interface: Runable

**Use this to update UI**
`Runnable` is an abstract interface which is uesd for Creating a new thread.
Well, `Runnable` is an interface without "start()". To start Runnable Thread, you have to input it to a Thread Class. In short, `Runnable` is just a Thread Model.

```java
private final Runnable mHidePart2Runnable = new Runnable() {
    @SuppressLint("InlinedApi")
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Delayed removal of status and navigation bar
        // Note that some of these constants are new as of API 16 (Jelly Bean)
        // and API 19 (KitKat). It is safe to use them, as they are inlined
        // at compile-time and do nothing on earlier devices.
        
        // This method is to set systemUI.
        mContentView.setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE
                | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN
                | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
                | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY
                | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
                | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION);
    }
};
```

To start a Runnable, you can

```java
// If handler is in a sub-thread, you should call Looper.prepare();
// Looper is a final Class.
Handler mhandler = new Handler();
mhandler.post(Runnable);
mhandler.postDelay(Runnable);
```

## Hide

### Hide AppBar(Action Bar)

```java
ActionBar actionBar = getSupportActionBar();
actionBar.hide();
```

## SetVisibility

Widget.setVisibility(int); 
Two parameters: 
 `View. VISIBLE and View. GONE`

## Event

Attention: All Events are interfaces which are named like On_____Listener.
Usually, we use View.setXXXListener(interface) to set a event listener.
Well, easy right~
This is what we call "Like MFC Mode."
