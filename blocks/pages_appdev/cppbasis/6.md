# Constexpr

## Why constexpr

`constexpr` can compute the expression while compiling.
`constexpr` can check if the code after can be constant.

## How to use

```cpp
constexpr float pi = 3 + 0.1415926535;
//Here I just want to show it can compute the expression.
```

## Any difference to const?

We know that const can be used to declare constants and decorate only-read.
`int add(const int a, const int b) return a+b; ` Here const means only-read.
constexpr was born in order to solve the ambiguity of const.
constexpr is uesd only to declare constants.
