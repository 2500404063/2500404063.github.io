# Lambda

## Lambda In C++

```cpp
[the ways to access variables out lambda domain] (parameters) mutable noexcept/throw() -> return type
{
   //TODO; 
};

[外部变量访问方式说明符] (参数) mutable noexcept/throw() -> 返回值类型
{
   函数体; 
};
```

## Ways to access variables
- []: don't access any variables out of lambda.
- [=]: to access all variables out of lambda by value.
- [&]: to access all variables out of lambda by referrence.
- [var1, var2, ...]: to access variables included by value.
- [&val1, &val2, ...]: to access variables included by referrence.
- [val, &val2, ...]: mix two ways
- [=, &var1, ...]: only access var1 by referrence.
- [this]: to access this pointer by value.(Always, we don't change this.)

## Decorations:

All of the decorations can be omitted.
- `mutable` : By default, all the variables included by value are constant. By declaring `mutable` , they can be changed.
- `noexcept/throw` : By default, lambda is decorated by throw. That means lambda enables throw exceptions.
