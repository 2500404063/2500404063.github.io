# Genericity

## The basis

**omit**

## Type deduction

### auto

`auto` is a keyword, which can deduct the left type according to the right value.
It is always used to declare a variable.

### decltype

`decltype` is the abbreviation of 'declare type', which can deduct the type according to an expression.
Example:

```cpp
int a = 1;
float b = 1.5;
decltype(a+b) c;
c = 5
```

`decltype(a+b)` means a type, float.

### Use in genericity

```cpp
template<typename _T1, typename _T2>
auto add(_T1 a, _T2 b) -> decltype(a + b){
    return a + b;
}
```
Codes above mean, the function can deduct the return type by using post-positioned decltype. So we use the symbol of `->` and `auto`.
